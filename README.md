Pomodoro Timer ⏲️

This Pomodoro Timer application is designed to enhance productivity and time management by implementing the Pomodoro Technique. Developed using Python's tkinter library, it features an intuitive graphical interface with start and reset buttons. Users can engage in 25-minute work sessions, followed by 5-minute short breaks, and every four sessions are rewarded with a 20-minute long break. The interface displays a tomato image as a central visual, symbolizing the technique’s origin, and updates with check marks after each work session, offering users a visual progress indicator. This tool is perfect for students, professionals, and anyone looking to break their tasks into manageable intervals for better focus and efficiency.
